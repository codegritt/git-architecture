Git inro


-Git is a version control system
-Each developer starts with a Git
-Each developer has their own local repository where they code and changes
-Each developer submits their perspective code to the remote repository 
where each developers code is analyzed

Git history and branches

-Branches are timeline in github
-Git tracks history called commit
-Commit is a change we made
-Commit is like a checkpoint a way to return to the previous code and make changes
-We make changes in local repositories and commit
-We can make multiple commits
-Then push them up to the local repository
-Pull happens then pulling all the changes happened in the remote repository to the local repository
-Merge happens with the local repository after this pull
-And combine them with whatever work already going on in local repository

-Master branches contains the timelines of all the changes happened
-the last commit is the recent change
-another side branch is created for code changes instead not actually affecting the master branch
-infinite number of sub branches can be created while working on complicated projects
